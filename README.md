# Conference-Management-System
Conference Management System
This project represents a console-based application for managing conferences, users, and venues with features like signing in, signing up, exploring conferences, organizing conferences, and more. It follows a modular structure with functions dedicated to specific tasks, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Steps to Run the Program
To install, build, and execute the Conference.cpp and ConferenceManagementMain.cpp files:

Place both files in your project directory.
Compile the ConferenceManagementMain.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler and execute the resulting executable to run the program.
Conference File
DateTime: Represents a date and time with methods for parsing and displaying dates and times.
Venue: Represents a venue for conferences, with methods for adding, deleting, and showing venues.
Conference: Represents a conference with a specific date, time, venue, organisers, participants, sponsors, and generated amount. It has methods for organising, sponsoring, registering participants, and checking available time slots.
User: Represents a user with basic information like name, age, registration number, gender, username, password, and email. It has methods for displaying user information, verifying login credentials, and updating user information.
Organiser: Inherits from User and represents an organiser with additional information like organisation name and organiser title.
Participant: Inherits from User and represents a participant with scheduled conferences and methods for scheduling and showing conferences.
Sponsor: Inherits from User and represents a sponsor with information about the sponsored event and the sponsored amount.
Main File
Function Declarations: It starts with function declarations for page_1(), page_2(User& user), exploreConferences(User& user), and createConferences(User& user). These functions handle different aspects of user interaction within the program.
Utility Functions: Following the declarations are utility functions like isDigits() to check if a string consists of digits only, and getIntegerInput() to get integer input from the user.
Data Management Functions: Functions like deleteAllExit() to clean up data and exit the program, and initialiseData() to set up initial data like venues and conferences.
User Interaction Functions: Functions like orgPortal() to provide a portal for organizers, exploreConferences() to allow users to explore conferences and take actions like joining or organizing them, and page_1() which serves as the main menu for signing in, signing up, or exiting the program.
User Authentication: sign_in() and sign_up() functions handle user authentication and registration respectively.
Main Function: The main() function initializes data, presents the main menu, and handles program exit.
